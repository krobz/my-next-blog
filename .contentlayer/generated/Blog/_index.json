      "raw": "\nRecently I came across an inspiring talk by Andrej Karpathy titled **\"Software Is Changing (Again)\"** (In Y Combinator Youtube channel: [Software Is Changing (Again)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ). The talk got me thinking deeply about how the essence of programming and software development is rapidly evolving under the influence of large language models (LLMs). Here are a few key insights and reflections inspired by Karpathy's presentation.\n\n## Three Paradigms of Software\n\nHistorically, software has been relatively static—mostly hand-crafted by developers using explicit programming languages like Python, Java, or JavaScript. Karpathy labels this traditional mode as **Software 1.0**, a world of human-written code instructing machines directly.\n\nThen came **Software 2.0**, powered by deep learning. Instead of manually coding logic, developers became data curators who trained neural networks. The model weights themselves represented the software. This paradigm shift allowed software to solve tasks like image recognition and language understanding that traditional methods struggled with.\n\nNow, we stand at the threshold of **Software 3.0**. Here, we program software in our own natural language through prompts—plain English instructions—directly interacting with powerful large language models. This radically shortens the distance between an idea and its implementation, effectively democratizing programming to anyone who can express their intent clearly. I feel it is changing to Software 3.0 in my daily work.\n\n![Andrej Karpathy_Software_layer_1.png](/static/images/AI/Andrej%20Karpathy_Software_layer_1.png)\n![Andrej Karpathy_Software_layer_2.png](/static/images/AI/Andrej%20Karpathy_Software_layer_2.png)\n_Source: [Software Is Changing (Again)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ)_\n\n## LLMs as Operating Systems\n\nOne particularly fascinating analogy Karpathy offered was comparing LLMs to early operating systems. Just as operating systems abstracted complex hardware interactions behind simple, intuitive commands, LLMs abstract away complexity by letting us interact through plain language.\n\nBut like early computers, today's LLMs remain centralized and costly. We're reminiscent of the 1960s era of computing—expensive mainframes accessed remotely. Personal, local LLM computing is still on the horizon, but early experiments suggest this may soon become feasible.\n\n## The Power (and Risk) of Partial Autonomy\n\nAnother intriguing concept Karpathy shared is the rise of **partially autonomous software**—tools that automate parts of our workflow while keeping humans actively involved. Good examples today include apps like Cursor for coding or Perplexity for research. They balance autonomy with human oversight through intuitive interfaces, allowing users to adjust how much control they hand over to the AI.\n\nThis idea resonates deeply because it highlights a critical truth: fully autonomous agents still aren't reliable enough to trust blindly. The sweet spot is a collaborative balance—humans guiding, verifying, and curating, with AI amplifying productivity. For this one I think it's pretty true now but maybe there will be some changes in the future.\n\n## Thinking About LLM Psychology\n\nKarpathy described LLMs humorously but insightfully as \"people spirits,\" complete with human-like flaws—excellent memory but prone to \"hallucinations,\" brilliant yet easily misled, powerful yet forgetful. Understanding these traits helps us craft more effective interactions. We need to build systems not just to exploit AI strengths, but to carefully mitigate their weaknesses.\n\n## Adapting Infrastructure for AI\n\nA particularly practical takeaway is that much of our current digital infrastructure—documentation, APIs, websites—was never designed with AI agents in mind. Karpathy suggested simple but transformative ideas:\n\n- Offering docs in structured Markdown instead of dense HTML.\n- Replacing click-heavy instructions with direct API calls.\n- Providing simple metadata files (e.g., `llm.txt`) to help AI agents navigate digital content easily.\n\nSmall tweaks like these can significantly improve the AI's ability to interact reliably with existing systems.\n\n## What This Means for the Future\n\nReflecting on Karpathy's insights, I believe we're entering a fascinating era of software development, marked by collaboration between humans and machines. Just as graphical interfaces once revolutionized human-computer interaction, natural-language prompting could fundamentally reshape software development, making it more accessible and intuitive.\n\nYet, we should temper our excitement with caution. Powerful as these models are, they require thoughtful design and vigilant human oversight. Partial autonomy—not total automation—is likely the safest, most productive near-term strategy.\n\nAs it cleverly put it, we're not yet at fully autonomous Iron Man suits. Rather, we're carefully building and adjusting partial autonomy sliders. Maybe in the future, writing **prompt** is just like we writing **code** today.\n",

Since this was a greenfield project built from scratch, I wanted to leverage the latest LTS features.\n\nThe project is a data pipeline system designed to fetch data from various sources and push it to downstream services via Kafka. The architecture is straightforward:\n\n![project structure](/static/images/virtual%20thread/structure.png)\n\nI encountered a significant bottleneck: some data sources provide large files. Processing these files sequentially was too slow, but spinning up a new platform thread for every row or chunk consumed too much memory.\n\nIt was a classic I/O-intensive scenario. My initial thought was to tune the thread pool, but that always involves a tradeoff between context-switching overhead and memory consumption. That's when **Virtual Threads** (Project Loom) came to mind. I decided to dive deep, research the implementation, and apply it to our pipeline.\n\nHere is my understanding of Virtual Threads, blending practical usage with internal mechanics.\n\n## What are Virtual Threads?\n\nVirtual threads were introduced as a preview feature in Java 19 and became official in **Java 21**.\n\nLet's look at how Java handled concurrency historically.\n\n### The \"Old\" Way: Platform Threads\n\nClassically, a `java.lang.Thread` is a **Platform Thread**. It is a thin wrapper around an operating system (OS) kernel thread.\n\n- **Mapping:** 1 Java Thread = 1 OS Thread (1:1 mapping).\n- **Cost:** Expensive. They carry a large stack (megabytes) and require OS-level context switching.\n- **Limitation:** You cannot create millions of them. The OS will run out of resources.\n\n### The \"New\" Way: Virtual Threads\n\n**Virtual Threads** are lightweight instances of `java.lang.Thread` that are _not_ permanently bound to a specific OS thread.\n\n- **Mapping:** Many Virtual Threads share a few OS Threads (M:N mapping).\n- **Cost:** Cheap. They have dynamic, heap-allocated stacks that grow and shrink.\n- **Scale:** You can create millions of them.\n\nWhen a virtual thread blocks on I/O (like reading a CSV or a network call), the JVM \"unmounts\" it from the OS thread, allowing the OS thread to do other work.\n\n![Virtual Thread Relationship](/static/images/virtual%20thread/virtual%20thread_relationship.png)\n\n### Virtual Threads vs. Coroutines\n\nIt sounds similar to Coroutines in Kotlin or Go, and conceptually it is. However, the key difference lies in the programming model:\n\n- **Coroutines (Kotlin/JS):** Often require `async/await` keywords, explicit suspension points, or \"colored functions\" (sync vs async).\n- **Virtual Threads (Java):** **No code change required.** You write standard, blocking synchronous code. The JVM handles the suspension magic transparently.\n\n## Why Virtual Threads?\n\n### 1. The \"Code Like It's 1999\" Simplicity\n\nThe biggest benefit isn't just performance—it's **readability**. We can write simple, sequential code that scales like complex asynchronous code.\n\n**The Reactive/Async Way (CompletableFuture Hell):**\n\n```java\n// Hard to debug, hard to read, stack traces are useless\nList<CompletableFuture<String>> futures = urls.stream()\n    .map(url -> CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {\n        try {\n            return httpClient.send(url).body();\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(e);\n        }\n    }, executorService))\n    .toList();\n\nCompletableFuture.allOf(futures.toArray(new CompletableFuture[0]))\n    .thenApply(v -> futures.stream()\n        .map(CompletableFuture::join)\n        .toList())\n    .join();\n```\n\n**The Virtual Thread Way:**\n\n```java\n// Looks like simple blocking code, but scales massively\ntry (var executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {\n    List<Future<String>> results = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    for (String url : urls) {\n        // Just submit a task. No complex chaining.\n        results.add(executor.submit(() ->\n            httpClient.send(url).body() // The JVM handles the blocking!\n        ));\n    }\n\n    // Retrieve results naturally\n    List<String> responses = results.stream()\n        .map(f -> {\n            try { return f.get(); }\n            catch (Exception e) { throw new RuntimeException(e); }\n        })\n        .toList();\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Efficient Resource Utilization\n\nBecause the JVM automatically unmounts virtual threads when they block, we don't block the precious OS threads. This is perfect for our CSV processing pipeline where we spend a lot of time waiting for I/O (reading files, waiting for Kafka acknowledgments).\n\n## Under the Hood: How JDK Implements It\n\nAt the implementation level, a virtual thread is essentially:\n\n> **A Thread subclass + A Continuation (Stack) + A Scheduler**\n\nI dug into the JDK source code to understand how this magic happens.\n\n### 1. Continuations: Capturing the Stack\n\nInternally, each virtual thread owns a `Continuation` object. Unlike a platform thread which has a monolithic block of memory, a virtual thread's stack is stored in the **Heap**.\n\nWhen a task pauses (blocks), the JVM copies the stack frames from the carrier thread into this heap object. When it resumes, it copies them back. This is what allows them to be so lightweight.\n\n### 2. The Scheduler (Carrier Threads)\n\nVirtual threads don't talk to the OS scheduler directly. Instead, Java uses a `ForkJoinPool` as a dedicated scheduler. The threads in this pool are called **Carrier Threads**.\n\nThe scheduling loop looks roughly like this:\n\n1.  **Mount:** The scheduler picks a virtual thread and \"mounts\" it onto a Carrier Thread (OS thread).\n2.  **Run:** The code executes until it hits a blocking call (e.g., `InputStream.read()`).\n3.  **Unmount:** The virtual thread yields. Its stack is saved to the heap. The Carrier Thread is now free to take another virtual thread.\n4.  **Resume:** When the I/O completes, the OS signals the JVM, and the virtual thread is scheduled to run again (potentially on a different Carrier Thread).\n\nThis allows a small number of Carrier Threads (usually equal to the number of CPU cores) to juggle millions of Virtual Threads.\n\nHere is a snippet from the JDK (simplified) showing the structure:\n\n```java\nfinal class VirtualThread extends BaseVirtualThread {\n    // The scheduler is usually a ForkJoinPool\n    private static final ForkJoinPool defaultScheduler = createDefaultScheduler();\n\n    private final Executor scheduler;\n    private final Continuation continuation;\n    private final Runnable runContinuation;\n\n    VirtualThread(Executor scheduler, String name, int flags, Runnable task) {\n        super(name, flags, /* bound = */ false);\n        // ... setup code ...\n        this.scheduler = scheduler;\n        this.continuation = new VThreadContinuation(this, task);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. The \"Pinning\" Problem\n\nWhile powerful, Virtual Threads aren't magic bullets. There is a specific limitation called **Pinning**.\n\nA virtual thread is \"pinned\" to its carrier thread if:\n\n1.  It is running inside a `synchronized` block or method.\n2.  It is executing a native method (JNI).\n\nWhen pinned, if the code blocks on I/O, it **cannot** unmount. It holds onto the OS thread, blocking it just like the old days.\n\n**Advice:** In modern Java (with Virtual Threads), prefer `ReentrantLock` over `synchronized` blocks if you expect I/O operations inside the lock. Although JEP 491 is working on fixing the `synchronized` pinning issue, it's good practice to be aware of it for high-throughput systems.\n\n## How to Use virtual thread?\n\n### 1. Simple Usage: The Executor\n\nThe easiest way to start is using `Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()`.\n\n```java\ntry (var executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {\n    IntStream.range(0, 10_000).forEach(i -> {\n        executor.submit(() -> {\n            Thread.sleep(Duration.ofSeconds(1));\n            return i;\n        });\n    });\n} // Implicitly waits for all 10,000 threads to finish here\n```\n\n### 2. Spring Boot Integration\n\nIf you are using Spring Boot 3.2+, it's literally one line of configuration:\n\n```properties\nspring.threads.virtual.enabled=true\n```\n\nThat's it. Tomcat and Jetty will now use virtual threads for request handling.\n\n## Some thoughts on virtual thread\n\n### 1. Do not pool Virtual Threads\n\nThis is the hardest habit to break. With platform threads, we used pools (like `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10)`) because threads were expensive resources that needed to be managed and reused.\n\nWith Virtual Threads, **threads are not resources; they are tasks.**\nThe number of virtual threads should always equal the number of concurrent tasks in your application. Converting $N$ platform threads to $N$ virtual threads yields little benefit. Instead, you should convert _tasks_ to virtual threads.\n\n**Anti-Pattern:**\n\n```java\n// DON'T DO THIS\nExecutorService sharedPool = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();\nFuture<Result> f = sharedPool.submit(task);\n```\n\n**Best Practice:**\nUse the **Structured Concurrency** pattern with `try-with-resources`. The executor itself is lightweight. Creating a new executor for a logical group of tasks allows the `close()` method to implicitly wait for all tasks to finish, preventing \"thread leaks\" and simplifying error handling.\n\n```java\n// DO THIS\ntry (var executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {\n    Future<Result> f1 = executor.submit(task1);\n    Future<Result> f2 = executor.submit(task2);\n}\n```\n\n### 2. \"Throughput\" vs. \"Latency\"\n\nDoes a virtual thread make a single request faster? **No.**\nA single task running on a virtual thread is not faster than on a platform thread (in fact, it might be infinitesimally slower due to mounting overhead).\n\n**The gain is in Throughput.** If your server can handle 1,000 concurrent requests with platform threads before crashing, it might handle 100,000 with virtual threads.\n\n### 3. The \"10,000 Threads\" Rule of Thumb?\n\nAs official document says: _\"If you don't need 10,000 concurrent threads, you don't need Virtual Threads.\"_\n\nI am a bit disagree on this. While it's true that the raw performance benefits (throughput) are negligible below this scale, there is another critical factor: **Maintainability.**\n\nEven for smaller applications, Virtual Threads allow you to write simple, synchronous-style code that is easier to read, debug, and test than Reactive or Async code (e.g., `CompletableFuture` or WebFlux). You get the simplicity of \"One Thread Per Request\" without the guilt of wasting OS resources.\n\nSo, use them not just for scale, but for **sanity**.\n\n### 4. Thread Safety still matters\n\nVirtual threads are essentially `java.lang.Thread` instances and adhere to the same **Java Memory Model (JMM)** as platform threads. This means:\n\n- **No Automatic Thread Safety:** Virtual threads are not \"safer\" than platform threads. Data races, visibility issues, and instruction reordering still exist.\n- **Same Tools:** `synchronized`, `ReentrantLock`, `AtomicInteger`, and `ConcurrentHashMap` work exactly the same way.\n\nHowever, virtual threads can amplify existing bugs due to scale:\n\n1.  **The Scale Problem:** In the past, you might have had 500 threads. A rare race condition might happen once a month. Now, with 100,000 virtual threads, that same race condition could happen every second.\n2.  **The Pinning Problem (Locks):** Using blocking synchronization (like `synchronized`) can \"pin\" the virtual thread to its carrier, preventing it from unmounting during I/O. While this doesn't break correctness, it kills the throughput benefits. **Use `ReentrantLock` or non-blocking structures where possible.**\n\n### 5. Limiting Concurrency? Don't use Pools, use Semaphores\n\nSometimes you need to limit concurrency not to save resources, but to protect downstream services (e.g., rate-limiting a 3rd party API to 10 concurrent requests).\n\nIn the platform thread era, we often abused thread pools for this:\n\n```java\n// OLD WAY: Abusing thread pool for rate limiting\nExecutorService rateLimitedPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);\nrateLimitedPool.submit(() -> callExternalService());\n```\n\nThis works, but it conflates \"resource management\" (pooling scarce threads) with \"flow control\".\n\nWith Virtual Threads, since we shouldn't pool them, we use the tool designed specifically for flow control: **`java.util.concurrent.Semaphore`**.\n\n```java\n// NEW WAY: Explicit flow control\nSemaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(10);\n\nvoid process() {\n    try {\n        semaphore.acquire(); // Blocks the virtual thread cheaply (unmounts)\n        callExternalService();\n    } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();\n    } finally {\n        semaphore.release();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nUnder the hood, blocking on a `Semaphore` allows the virtual thread to unmount, just like blocking on I/O. It creates a queue of blocked tasks, which is conceptually identical to a Thread Pool's task queue, but without the overhead of managing a pool of heavy worker threads.\n\n**Note on DB Pools:** Database connection pools (like HikariCP) act as implicit semaphores. If you have a pool of 10 DB connections, the 11th virtual thread will simply block waiting for a connection. You don't need an extra semaphore there.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf you are building I/O-heavy applications (web servers, data pipelines) in Java 21+, Virtual Threads should be a good choice in most cases.\n",

      "raw": "\n## Introduction\n\nMy journey with data structures, algorithms, and competitive programming started quite early and took several interesting turns over the years. Reflecting on these experiences helps me appreciate the growth and changes in my approach and passion.\n\n## Early Days and NOIP\n\nMy journey began around 2009, during secondary school. Our school organized a science festival requiring every student to pick a project. I chose the National Olympiad in Informatics in Provinces (NOIP), Basic Division. At the time, I had never studied data structures or algorithms. My first exposure came through a C programming textbook written by Haoqiang Tan, a prominent educator. Looking back ten years later, I realized the book was quite outdated and unprofessional by modern standards.\n\nFortunately, my father, who majored in computer science, quickly guided me through the basics. I still vividly remember him teaching me fundamental C syntax using a whiteboard. In my third year of secondary school, I participated in NOIP Basic Division, achieving a high score in the first round, thus qualifying for the finals in a bigger city three hours away. Despite minimal preparation, I managed a small prize in the second round—a hands-on competition where we needed to solve four problems within a limited time. Due to my lack of practice, even handling file input/output posed challenges.\n\n## Advanced Division and High School\n\nDuring the summer after secondary school graduation, my father connected me with an IT teacher from my future high school. I joined an intensive training camp aimed at the NOIP Advanced Division. Winning first prize in this competition meant direct admission to top universities. This training exposed me to talented peers—many of whom later entered prestigious universities globally and excelled in the computer science industry. I learned advanced algorithms, including graph theory and dynamic programming, and dedicated at least one hour daily to practice.\n\nAfter three months, I took the NOIP Advanced Division exam, performing exceptionally well in the first round despite the test's high difficulty. Although my score was under 40 out of 100, it ranked first in my city. However, similar to my previous experience, I did not perform as well in the second round. This setback led me to doubt my talent in competitive programming. Coupled with academic pressure from other subjects, I decided to abandon competitive programming—a decision I occasionally regret, especially seeing classmates who succeeded later.\n\n## University and Rediscovering Programming\n\nInitially, I chose Mechanical Engineering in university due to concerns about prolonged computer use causing neck strain—a reason that now seems amusing yet valid. Although I excelled in programming-related courses like C++, embedded systems, and MATLAB, I did not actively pursue competitive programming opportunities such as ACM-ICPC, which remains another regret.\n\n## Postgraduate Studies and Return to CS\n\nDuring my postgraduate studies at HKUST, my focus shifted to advanced topics like 3D printing, particularly 5-axis printing. I wrote numerous MATLAB scripts and notably produced a support-free Red Bird Sundial model—mirroring the sculpture at HKUST's entrance.\n\nAfter graduation, aiming for a Ph.D. under Professor Kai Tang but lacking funding, I joined HKUST's Department of Computer Science and Engineering as a research assistant under Professors Chi-Keung Tang, Robin Ma, and Matthew Ming-Fai Yuen. My work revolved around building a fascinating 3D garment fitting system, extensively using C++ and OpenGL. My primary role involved geometric algorithm research rather than pure software development.\n\n## Discovering LeetCode\n\nIn 2019, while seeking to enhance my computer science fundamentals, I discovered LeetCode. Like many others, I found my first problem—\"Two Sum\"—challenging but rewarding. Solving it reignited my interest in data structures and algorithms after nearly a decade-long hiatus. This marked a turning point, and I realized my passion for algorithmic problem-solving had never fully disappeared.\n",

      "raw": "\n## Graduate Studies and Rekindling Interest\n\nIn 2019, my engagement with LeetCode was limited due to applications for a second master's degree. At that point, I shifted my academic interest from hardware-focused research to software and artificial intelligence. I was accepted into the Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence program at Nanyang Technological University (NTU).\n\nWith the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, my courses moved online. Considering future job opportunities, I realized data structures and algorithms would be essential skills. Thus, I returned to LeetCode, predominantly solving problems in C++, despite primarily using Python for coursework. Initially, I followed a recommended [problem list](https://zxi.mytechroad.com/blog/leetcode-problem-categories/), which proved quite challenging at first. Nonetheless, I solved around 300 LeetCode problems that year and participated in several contests. Notably, I successfully completed all four questions in Weekly Contest 213—a memorable milestone. Additionally, I participated in Google Kick Start contests, though my performance highlighted the need for further practic.\n\n## Transition to Java and Professional Career\n\nAfter graduating from NTU, I secured a job in Singapore, where my professional work required proficiency in Java. Consequently, I transitioned from C++ to Java. During 2021 and early 2022, my LeetCode practice decreased significantly as I focused primarily on AWS technologies and job-related responsibilities. My practice was mainly limited to reinforcing my familiarity with Java syntax and fundamental problem-solving techniques.\n\n## Rediscovering Algorithmic Passion\n\nIn late 2022, my passion for algorithms reignited, driving me back to LeetCode. This time, I began with the resources from [labuladong](https://labuladong.online/algo/home/), which helped me quickly regain momentum. Throughout 2023, I actively participated in contests and achieved notable rankings. My renewed enthusiasm carried into 2024 and 2025, initially motivated by interview preparation but evolving into genuine personal interest. Currently, I follow an excellent curated [problem list](https://leetcode.cn/discuss/post/3578981/ti-dan-hua-dong-chuang-kou-ding-chang-bu-rzz7/) by \"灵神,\" a top competitive programmer and teacher in China. To date, I have solved over 800 problems. Yet, it's not merely the number that matters, but rather the insights and deeper understanding I've gained through this rigorous journey. Looking ahead, I am considering exploring platforms like Codeforces once I feel confident tackling most of LeetCode's hard problems.\n\n## Important Algorithmic topics\n\nThroughout my journey, I have found certain topics particularly important (try to keep updating):\n\n- **For Interviews:**\n\n  - Two Pointers\n  - Depth-First Search (DFS)\n  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)\n  - Trees\n  - Linked Lists\n  - Graph Theory\n  - Basic Data Structures (Hash Map, Hash Set)\n  - Binary Search\n\n  (Future interviews might include even more challenging topics—I've already encountered problems involving the **Hierholzer** algorithm!)\n\n- **For LeetCode Contests:**\n  - Dynamic Programming (like Digit DP)\n  - DFS and BFS\n  - Advanced Graph Algorithms (like Dijkstra, Floyd)\n  - Mathematics (with many complex subtopics)\n  - Greedy Algorithms\n  - String Algorithms (like KMP, Z-function)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMy continuous exploration of algorithms and data structures has significantly shaped my career path and personal interests. Although my achievements so far fill me with pride, I know I’m still at the very beginning of this algorithmic journey. Reflecting on this motivates me to keep learning and growing, and to ultimately fulfill the aspirations I set for myself back in high school. The road ahead is exciting and full of potential, and I look forward to sharing more insights and experiences along the way.\n",

      "raw": "\nI've recently (maybe not that recently lol) interviewed with several companies in Singapore, and I'd like to share some of my experiences (currently most on LeetCode style questions) and insights gained from these interviews. I’ll continue to update this series.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I haven't signed any NDAs, and I will not mention any specific company names.\n\nI will start with a prominent Chinese software company.\n\n## Round 1: Algorithm Test\n\nThe first round consisted of three algorithm problems. I don't recall the exact questions, but they weren't overly challenging. The last question involved dynamic programming (DP) with stringent test cases, making it difficult to pass all of them. I successfully solved about 70% of the cases, which allowed me to advance to the next round.\n\n## Round 2: Technical Interview\n\nThe second round focused on technical questions based on my professional experience. Here are some highlights:\n\n1. **What's the iteration cycle of your project (e.g., monthly, bi-monthly)?**\n2. **How do you deploy applications on AWS and utilize serverless architecture?**\n3. **Why do you use Elasticsearch, and how do you ensure consistency between Elasticsearch and the database?**\n4. **How do you handle duplicate message consumption in message queues?**\n5. **How do you resolve Maven JAR dependency conflicts?**\n\nThese questions were fairly standard. For question 3 specifically, I explained that the solution depends heavily on the particular use case. And I want to share a bit of question 5, I believe this is a bit common in real development:\n\n### Understanding and Resolving Maven Dependency Conflicts\n\nMaven picks one version per `groupId:artifactId` using:\n\n- **Shortest-Path Priority:** selects the version with the fewest hops.\n- **Declaration-Order Priority:** if tied, the earlier `pom.xml` entry wins.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```text\nDependency path 1: A → B → C → X(1.5)  // distance = 3\nDependency path 2: A → D → X(1.0)     // distance = 2\n```\n\n**Issue:** If module C needs X 1.5 but Maven picks X 1.0, you’ll see `NoClassDefFoundError` or `NoSuchMethodError`.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. **Upgrade the direct parent** (e.g., D) to a version that brings in X 1.5.\n2. **Exclude the older X**: Generally, when resolving dependency conflicts, we prioritize the higher version, because most JARs maintain backward compatibility when upgraded:\n   ```xml\n    <dependency>\n        ......\n        <exclusions>\n        <exclusion>\n            <artifactId>x</artifactId>\n            <groupId>org.apache.x</groupId>\n        </exclusion>\n        </exclusions>\n    </dependency>\n   ```\n\nAdditionally, there was one coding problem: [LeetCode 179: Largest Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number/description/). I found this question particularly interesting and suitable for interviews. The problem statement is:\n\n> Given a list of non-negative integers `nums`, arrange them to form the largest possible number and return it as a string.\n\nInitially, I got stuck for about 10 minutes, considering a monotonic stack and greedy approach. However, the key insight is straightforward yet subtle: for two numbers `a` and `b`, `a` should come before `b` if the concatenation `ab` is greater than `ba`. While this seems intuitively greedy, the rigorous proof is nuanced. A comprehensive explanation can be found [here](https://leetcode.cn/problems/largest-number/solutions/716725/gong-shui-san-xie-noxiang-xin-ke-xue-xi-vn86e/) (Chinese but this is the best proof I've seen).\n\nHere's my final solution:\n\n```java\nclass Solution {\n    public String largestNumber(int[] nums) {\n        int n = nums.length;\n        Integer[] converted = new Integer[n];\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            converted[i] = nums[i];\n        }\n\n        Arrays.sort(converted, (a, b) -> {\n            String s1 = String.valueOf(a) + String.valueOf(b);\n            String s2 = String.valueOf(b) + String.valueOf(a);\n            return s2.compareTo(s1);\n        });\n\n        if (converted[0] == 0) {\n            return \"0\";\n        }\n\n        StringBuilder ans = new StringBuilder();\n        for (int num : converted) {\n            ans.append(num);\n        }\n\n        return ans.toString();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Round 3: Behavioral Interview\n\n- **Focus:** Common behavioral questions\n- **Key Question:** “Why did you change your major from Mechanical Engineering to Computer Science?”\n- **Frequency:** Asked in about 80% of my interviews\n- **My Typical Responses:**\n  1. **Interest:** I participated in competitive programming during high school, developing a keen interest in computer science early on. Although I initially chose Mechanical Engineering for other reasons, my passion for computing remained strong.\n  2. **Natural Transition:** In Mechanical Engineering, I often worked with CAD and programmed in MATLAB and C++ on various projects, which made transitioning to software development smooth.\n  3. **From AI to Development:** While my Master’s focused on AI, I realized I needed more hands-on software development and implementation experience before diving deeper into AI research.\n\nIn the end, I successfully cleared all of the interviews.\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\n- **Practice coding under time pressure.** Sometimes can get stuck in a non-hard problem, take it easy.\n- **Craft a compelling personal narrative.** Frame your background changes as a journey of passion and growth.\n",

      "raw": "\nIn my previous article, I shared my interview experience with a Chinese tech company. Today, I'll continue the journey by sharing my experiences with two other companies: one in the financial sector (Company A) and another in the travel industry (Company B). Both are well-known companies in their respective industries.\n\n## My Interview Experience\n\n### Company A (Financial Sector)\n\nI was contacted by a headhunter for this position. While the process moved quite fast, I have to be honest - this was the worst interview experience I've had so far. The interviewer was 10 minutes late and didn't ask many substantial questions. It felt rushed and unprofessional, which was disappointing given the company's reputation in the financial sector.\n\n### Company B (Travel Industry)\n\nThis company had a more structured approach. They started with an online coding test featuring LeetCode-style problems. I can't recall the exact questions, but they were around medium difficulty level, and I managed to clear all of them successfully.\n\nWhat made this interview unique was the role itself - \"Senior Intelligence Engineer.\" It sounded intriguing and different from typical SDE positions. The interview process was smooth, and the interviewer was genuinely nice and professional. However, they placed a heavy emphasis on security-related questions, which caught me a bit off guard.\n\n## Technical Questions & Solutions\n\n### 1. System Design: Multi-Platform API Gateway\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nA company has Android, iOS, and Web clients, each calling different API hostnames (e.g., `api1.example.com`, `api2.example.com`, `api3.example.com`). Behind these APIs, multiple microservices handle the actual business logic. Every microservice must know \"who the caller is\" for authentication and authorization. Additionally, these APIs expose data (pricing, search results, etc.) that external scrapers might harvest at scale.\n\n**Design Task:**\nDesign an authentication and gateway layer that sits in front of all APIs and microservices. Your solution should address:\n\n1. **Stateless Authentication**: Issue and verify JWT tokens so any API hostname can authenticate user requests\n2. **Unified Gateway**: Route requests through a single API Gateway that validates tokens, enforces per-endpoint rate limits, and forwards traffic to the correct microservice\n3. **Anti-Scraping Protection**: Prevent large-scale scraping through rate limiting, throttling, and bot detection\n\n_Note: I won't dive into the complete solution here due to space constraints, but the key is to implement a centralized authentication service with distributed token validation and multi-layered protection mechanisms. I will update if time is allowed._\n\n### 2. Architecture Choice: DynamoDB + Elasticsearch\n\n**Context:** I was joined in the design of a system to store business files from customers, choosing DynamoDB + Elasticsearch as our data layer.\n\n**Why DynamoDB?**\n\n- **Eventual Consistency Tolerance**: Our system doesn't require strong consistency. If users upload a file and can't search it immediately, they can refresh and find it - this trade-off makes DynamoDB cost-effective\n- **Schema Flexibility**: DynamoDB's schema-less nature means zero downtime when adding or removing fields, which is crucial in our business scenario where schema changes are frequent\n\n**Why Elasticsearch?**\n\n- **Full-Text Search**: Provides powerful search capabilities based on Lucene's inverted index\n- **Complex Aggregations**: Enables sophisticated data analysis (histograms, top-N queries, grouping) that would be expensive in traditional databases. This is essential since each receipt can contain multiple files requiring aggregation\n\n### 3. Data Architecture: Duplication Strategy & Key Design\n\n**Data Duplication Approach:**\nWe don't duplicate all data between DynamoDB and Elasticsearch - only what's necessary for search functionality. We use DynamoDB Streams with Lambda triggers to automatically index relevant data in Elasticsearch whenever DynamoDB records are updated.\n\n**Key Design:**\n\n- **DynamoDB Primary Key**: Composite key of `(linkId, userIdHash)`\n  - `linkId`: Uniquely identifies each document\n  - `userIdHash`: Ensures even data distribution across partitions\n- **Elasticsearch Index**: Contains only fields needed for text search and aggregations, while non-searchable metadata remains in DynamoDB\n\n### 4. Inverted Index: The Foundation of Full-Text Search\n\n**Why Inverted Index?**\nTraditional relational databases are row-oriented - searching across arbitrary columns is expensive. An inverted index flips this concept: for each unique term, I store a list of document IDs containing that term.\n\n**Structure Example:**\n\n```\n\"hotel\" → [doc1, doc3, doc5, ...]\n\"flight\" → [doc2, doc4, doc6, ...]\n```\n\nWhen querying \"hotel + flight,\" the system quickly fetches both lists, intersects or ranks them, and returns the top matches. This approach is exponentially faster for text search scenarios.\n\n### 5. TF-IDF: The Ranking Algorithm\n\nI'll be honest - this wasn't my strongest area during the interview, so I had to research it afterward:\n\n**TF (Term Frequency)**: How often a term appears in a document. Higher frequency suggests greater relevance to that document.\n\n**IDF (Inverse Document Frequency)**: Logarithm of (total documents ÷ documents containing the term). Rare terms get higher IDF weights, while common terms like \"the\" get lower weights.\n\n**TF-IDF Score**: Typically TF × IDF (or variants like BM25) measures how important a term is in a specific document relative to the entire corpus. Higher combined scores rank higher in search results.\n\n### 6. Multi-Term Query Ranking\n\n**Question**: Given a query with multiple terms (e.g., \"hotel flight\"), how do you compute ranking?\n\n**Solution**: For each matching document, calculate a combined score using the sum or weighted sum of TF-IDF (or BM25) scores for each term (\"hotel\" and \"flight\"). Documents with higher combined scores rank higher in results.\n\n### 7. Prefix Search Implementation\n\n**Challenge**: Support prefix searches where users type \"hot\" and expect \"hotel\" suggestions.\n\n**Solution**: I configured a reverse edge n-gram analyzer. During indexing, each token is broken into partial prefixes:\n\n```\n\"hotel\" → [\"h\", \"ho\", \"hot\", \"hote\", \"hotel\"]\n```\n\nThis allows instant matching of partial inputs to complete terms.\n\n### 8. Handling Misspelled Queries\n\n**Challenge**: Users type \"htel\" or \"hetel\" instead of \"hotel\".\n\n**Two Approaches:**\n\n1. **Autocomplete/Typeahead**: Show dropdown suggestions as users type \"ho...\" displaying \"hotel,\" \"hostel,\" etc., preventing mistakes before they happen\n2. **Fuzzy Query**: Configure Elasticsearch to allow edit distance of 1-2 characters. Searches for \"htel\" or \"hetel\" still match \"hotel\" because only one character is different or transposed\n\nI implemented the second approach for our use case.\n\n### 9. Search API Performance Metrics\n\n**Question**: How do you measure search API performance? Is average response time sufficient?\n\n**Answer**: Average latency alone can be misleading because it hides outliers - a few very slow requests get diluted by many fast ones.\n\n**Better Metrics:**\n\n- **P90 and P99 latencies**: Show how slow the tail requests are (90th/99th percentiles)\n- **Throughput**: Requests per second under load\n- **Error rates**: Failed requests percentage\n\nIn our optimization, I improved average latency by 35% and P95 latency by 50%, indicating that even the slowest 5% of requests became significantly faster.\n\n### 10. Distributed Transactional Consistency Framework\n\n**Question**: How do you ensure data consistency across distributed microservices when handling complex business transactions?\n\n**My Response**: To be completely honest, I haven't implemented a full distributed transactional consistency framework in production yet. However, I understand the theoretical concepts and common patterns used in the industry.\n\n**Key Concepts I'm Familiar With**:\n\n#### 1. **Saga Pattern**\n\nThis is widely used. The saga pattern handles distributed transactions by breaking them into smaller, manageable steps:\n\n- **Orchestration**: A central coordinator manages the transaction flow\n- **Choreography**: Services communicate through events without a central coordinator\n- Each step has a compensating transaction for rollback scenarios\n\n#### 2. **Event Sourcing**\n\nInstead of storing current state, you store all the events that led to that state:\n\n- All state changes are captured as immutable events\n- You can replay events to reconstruct system state\n- Provides natural audit trail and debugging capabilities\n\n#### 3. **Two-Phase Commit (2PC)**\n\nTraditional approach but has limitations in distributed systems:\n\n- Prepare phase: All participants vote to commit or abort\n- Commit phase: Coordinator tells everyone to commit or rollback\n- Problems: Single point of failure, blocking protocol\n\n#### 4. **Eventual Consistency**\n\nAccept that data might be temporarily inconsistent:\n\n- Design systems to handle inconsistency gracefully\n- Use techniques like conflict resolution and convergence\n- Often paired with compensation mechanisms\n\n#### 5. **Idempotency**\n\nEnsure operations can be safely retried:\n\n- Use unique request IDs to detect duplicates\n- Store operation results to handle retries\n- Critical for handling network failures and timeouts\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nThese interviews taught me valuable lessons about system design thinking and the importance of understanding the \"why\" behind architectural decisions. One key insight I gained: It's much better to have real industry experience when discussing solutions in system design interviews. If you're not familiar with a particular technology or approach, just be honest and say you're not familiar with it.\n\nAuthenticity goes a long way in interviews. Interviewers can usually tell when you're trying to bluff your way through technical concepts you don't actually understand. Being upfront about your knowledge gaps while showing genuine curiosity to learn often leaves a better impression than pretending to know everything.\n\nThe technical depth required for senior roles is significant, and there's always more to learn. These interview experiences reminded me that continuous learning and honest self-assessment are just as important as technical skills in building a successful engineering career.\n",
