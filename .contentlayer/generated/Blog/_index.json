      "raw": "\n## Introduction\n\nMy journey with data structures, algorithms, and competitive programming started quite early and took several interesting turns over the years. Reflecting on these experiences helps me appreciate the growth and changes in my approach and passion.\n\n## Early Days and NOIP\n\nMy journey began around 2009, during secondary school. Our school organized a science festival requiring every student to pick a project. I chose the National Olympiad in Informatics in Provinces (NOIP), Basic Division. At the time, I had never studied data structures or algorithms. My first exposure came through a C programming textbook written by Haoqiang Tan, a prominent educator. Looking back ten years later, I realized the book was quite outdated and unprofessional by modern standards.\n\nFortunately, my father, who majored in computer science, quickly guided me through the basics. I still vividly remember him teaching me fundamental C syntax using a whiteboard. In my third year of secondary school, I participated in NOIP Basic Division, achieving a high score in the first round, thus qualifying for the finals in a bigger city three hours away. Despite minimal preparation, I managed a small prize in the second round—a hands-on competition where we needed to solve four problems within a limited time. Due to my lack of practice, even handling file input/output posed challenges.\n\n## Advanced Division and High School\n\nDuring the summer after secondary school graduation, my father connected me with an IT teacher from my future high school. I joined an intensive training camp aimed at the NOIP Advanced Division. Winning first prize in this competition meant direct admission to top universities. This training exposed me to talented peers—many of whom later entered prestigious universities globally and excelled in the computer science industry. I learned advanced algorithms, including graph theory and dynamic programming, and dedicated at least one hour daily to practice.\n\nAfter three months, I took the NOIP Advanced Division exam, performing exceptionally well in the first round despite the test's high difficulty. Although my score was under 40 out of 100, it ranked first in my city. However, similar to my previous experience, I did not perform as well in the second round. This setback led me to doubt my talent in competitive programming. Coupled with academic pressure from other subjects, I decided to abandon competitive programming—a decision I occasionally regret, especially seeing classmates who succeeded later.\n\n## University and Rediscovering Programming\n\nInitially, I chose Mechanical Engineering in university due to concerns about prolonged computer use causing neck strain—a reason that now seems amusing yet valid. Although I excelled in programming-related courses like C++, embedded systems, and MATLAB, I did not actively pursue competitive programming opportunities such as ACM-ICPC, which remains another regret.\n\n## Postgraduate Studies and Return to CS\n\nDuring my postgraduate studies at HKUST, my focus shifted to advanced topics like 3D printing, particularly 5-axis printing. I wrote numerous MATLAB scripts and notably produced a support-free Red Bird Sundial model—mirroring the sculpture at HKUST's entrance.\n\nAfter graduation, aiming for a Ph.D. under Professor Kai Tang but lacking funding, I joined HKUST's Department of Computer Science and Engineering as a research assistant under Professors Chi-Keung Tang, Robin Ma, and Matthew Ming-Fai Yuen. My work revolved around building a fascinating 3D garment fitting system, extensively using C++ and OpenGL. My primary role involved geometric algorithm research rather than pure software development.\n\n## Discovering LeetCode\n\nIn 2019, while seeking to enhance my computer science fundamentals, I discovered LeetCode. Like many others, I found my first problem—\"Two Sum\"—challenging but rewarding. Solving it reignited my interest in data structures and algorithms after nearly a decade-long hiatus. This marked a turning point, and I realized my passion for algorithmic problem-solving had never fully disappeared.\n",

      "raw": "\n## Graduate Studies and Rekindling Interest\n\nIn 2019, my engagement with LeetCode was limited due to applications for a second master's degree. At that point, I shifted my academic interest from hardware-focused research to software and artificial intelligence. I was accepted into the Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence program at Nanyang Technological University (NTU).\n\nWith the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, my courses moved online. Considering future job opportunities, I realized data structures and algorithms would be essential skills. Thus, I returned to LeetCode, predominantly solving problems in C++, despite primarily using Python for coursework. Initially, I followed a recommended [problem list](https://zxi.mytechroad.com/blog/leetcode-problem-categories/), which proved quite challenging at first. Nonetheless, I solved around 300 LeetCode problems that year and participated in several contests. Notably, I successfully completed all four questions in Weekly Contest 213—a memorable milestone. Additionally, I participated in Google Kick Start contests, though my performance highlighted the need for further practic.\n\n## Transition to Java and Professional Career\n\nAfter graduating from NTU, I secured a job in Singapore, where my professional work required proficiency in Java. Consequently, I transitioned from C++ to Java. During 2021 and early 2022, my LeetCode practice decreased significantly as I focused primarily on AWS technologies and job-related responsibilities. My practice was mainly limited to reinforcing my familiarity with Java syntax and fundamental problem-solving techniques.\n\n## Rediscovering Algorithmic Passion\n\nIn late 2022, my passion for algorithms reignited, driving me back to LeetCode. This time, I began with the resources from [labuladong](https://labuladong.online/algo/home/), which helped me quickly regain momentum. Throughout 2023, I actively participated in contests and achieved notable rankings. My renewed enthusiasm carried into 2024 and 2025, initially motivated by interview preparation but evolving into genuine personal interest. Currently, I follow an excellent curated [problem list](https://leetcode.cn/discuss/post/3578981/ti-dan-hua-dong-chuang-kou-ding-chang-bu-rzz7/) by \"灵神,\" a top competitive programmer and teacher in China. To date, I have solved over 800 problems. Yet, it's not merely the number that matters, but rather the insights and deeper understanding I've gained through this rigorous journey. Looking ahead, I am considering exploring platforms like Codeforces once I feel confident tackling most of LeetCode's hard problems.\n\n<div className=\"w-full overflow-hidden\">\n  <img src=\"/static/images/algorithm/leetcode_profile.png\" alt=\"Maple\" className=\"h-auto w-full\" />\n</div>\n\n## Important Algorithmic topics\n\nThroughout my journey, I have found certain topics particularly important (try to keep updating):\n\n- **For Interviews:**\n\n  - Two Pointers\n  - Depth-First Search (DFS)\n  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)\n  - Trees\n  - Linked Lists\n  - Graph Theory\n  - Basic Data Structures (Hash Map, Hash Set)\n  - Binary Search\n\n  (Future interviews might include even more challenging topics—I've already encountered problems involving the **Hierholzer** algorithm!)\n\n- **For LeetCode Contests:**\n  - Dynamic Programming (like Digit DP)\n  - DFS and BFS\n  - Advanced Graph Algorithms (like Dijkstra, Floyd)\n  - Mathematics (with many complex subtopics)\n  - Greedy Algorithms\n  - String Algorithms (like KMP, Z-function)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMy continuous exploration of algorithms and data structures has significantly shaped my career path and personal interests. Although my achievements so far fill me with pride, I know I’m still at the very beginning of this algorithmic journey. Reflecting on this motivates me to keep learning and growing, and to ultimately fulfill the aspirations I set for myself back in high school. The road ahead is exciting and full of potential, and I look forward to sharing more insights and experiences along the way.\n",
